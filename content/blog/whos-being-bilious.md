title: We're not in WordPress anymore
description: 'Brief precis on why this site is built in Gatsby, and not WordPress.'

Normally, I'd turn to WordPress to build a website. It's easy to use, has a fairly simple UI and with the advent of Gutenberg blocks it's now becoming real easy to crank out a nice website, pretty quickly.

But.

* You still have to update plugins
* You still have to pay for hosting
* It's a lot of work to make it performant
* There's always some joker trying to hack it

I currently use AWS Lightsail to host sites, and their cheapest tier is about $3.50 per month. I know S3 and EC are cheaper, but Lightsail is easier. It's simplicity I'm after see? And speed. And security. And I don't really want to host anything myself if I can help it. We live in a service based economy and I want stuff that's prebuilt that I can use, not setup.
